PROCEDURE FOR THE 1st LAB ASSIGNMENT

1. Download python tool uncompyle6

2. Change file extension from compress.py to compress.py

3. Run uncompyle6 compress.pyc > compress.py

4. Get the source code for the compress.py program.

5. Now we want to unzip the password protected zip.
5.1 To do that, we will use the text found in munich.txt as a dictionary.
5.2 A dictionary must have a word for line, so we replace every space for a \n with the following command
5.3 cat munich.txt | tr -d [':punct:'] | tr ' ' '\n' > dict.txt

6. Now we use fcrackzip to try and find the zip password.
6.1 fcrackzip -u -D -p dict.txt online_banking.zip

7. Now, to unzip the file, we use this command and the password already found on step 6:
7.1 unzip online_banking.zip -d ./online_banking_zip

8. While trying to open the drone-A.bmp file, we notice that because we can't open it, this file might be corrupted. So we're going to use hexdump and check for the magic numbers.
8.1 using hexeditor, we can see that the file has been tampered with, and we can change it back to its original format, png, substituting the first 6 characters and changing the file extension to .png
